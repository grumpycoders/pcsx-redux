// Self-contained per-voice resampler. Owns the fractional pitch position and
// step, takes the freshly decoded ADPCM samples, and produces one output at the
// emulator's 44.1kHz mixing rate, in one of four modes (none / "Pete's common
// sense" linear / hardware-accurate gaussian / cubic). Extracted out of the
// MainThread synthesis loop and the SPU impl; the math is unchanged.
//
// The working set is five int32 slots that the two mode families alias
// differently: gauss/cubic pack a four-tap int16 window into m_state[1] and
// m_state[2] and use m_state[0] as the ring index, while the linear modes use
// m_state[0] as the step, m_state[1..3] as delay slots and m_state[4] as a
// recompute flag. That overlap is deliberate, which is why they stay one block
// rather than becoming five named members.
//
// The slots used to live in the tail of the per-voice sample buffer, SB[28..32],
// so that the whole thing serialized as one savestate field. They are members
// now and saveTo()/loadFrom() mirror them back into those same SB indices, so
// the savestate format is unchanged. Nothing else here touches the channel: the
// four-tap window is our own, so storeVal()/getVal() need no buffer passed in
// and this class only mentions Protobuf in the savestate mirrors.
