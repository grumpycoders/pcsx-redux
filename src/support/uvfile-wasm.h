// The wasm build has no libuv, no curl and no worker thread, so uvfile.cc is not
// compiled. This declares the same names with synchronous implementations, so
// that every caller - the cdriso readers, isobrowser, the Lua file bindings,
// SIO1 - keeps compiling unchanged.
//
// The rule here is that a stub must be HONEST, not silent. A download does not
// pretend to succeed: it constructs a file that reports failed(). A fifo has no
// socket, so it is a failed file too. Caching is instantaneous rather than
// absent, because a PosixFile really is fully available the moment it opens.
// Nothing in here reports success for work it did not do.
