// refresh rate in PAL. Preferably call this from timer1's

//   void * buffer = malloc(file_size(mod_file));
//   readfile(mod_file, buffer);
//   uint32_t size = MOD_Load(buffer);

//     free(buffer);
//     return false;
//   }
//   MOD_Relocate(buffer);

// The volume will always be centered, so the sample will
// be monaural. The voiceID ideally should be set to a

// has 24 channels total, so voiceID can be between 0 and 23.
// The note is a value between 0 and 35. The exact note played
// is on the normal 12-notes, C, C#, D, ... scale, and there
// are three octaves available, which gives the 12*3=36
// interval value of the note argument. The volume argument
// is between 0 and 63. You can simulate KeyOff by simply
// setting the volume of the voice to 0. The volume will
// be affected by the music volume as set by the function above.
