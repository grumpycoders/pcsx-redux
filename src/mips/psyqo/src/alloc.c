// TL;DR: this is a simple memory allocator that uses a linked list of
// empty blocks to keep track of the free memory. Allocated blocks
// are not tracked, but have a header that contains the size of the block.
// Memory is always aligned to 8 bytes on 32-bit platforms, and 16 bytes on
// 64-bit platforms. The allocator is not thread-safe, and is not
// re-entrant. It is not designed to be used in a multi-threaded environment.
// The allocator is designed to be used in a way where memory fragmentation
// is minimal, and where the heap is not resized. The more memory is
// fragmented, the slower the allocator will be. Last but not least, the
// memory allocator respects the posix malloc/free/realloc interface, in
// particular:
// 1. Allocating 0 bytes will return a valid pointer, which can be freed.
// 2. Re-allocating a pointer to a smaller size is always guaranteed to
//    succeed and to return the same pointer.
// 3. Re-allocating a pointer to 0 bytes will behave as if free was called.
// 4. Re-allocating a NULL pointer will behave like a call to malloc.

// Align to 8 bytes on 32-bit platforms,
// and 16 bytes on 64-bit platforms.
