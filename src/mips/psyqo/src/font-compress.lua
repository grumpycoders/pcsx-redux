-- This is the code used to generate the file system-font.inc, from a raw font file.
-- The compression system assumes font width of 8 pixels, but has otherwise no
-- condition on the font height. The expected input file format is to be in raw
-- greyscale 4bpp, fully black and white, meaning each byte from the input file
-- should only have the hexadecimal values 00, 01, 10, or 11. The organization of
-- the input image should be 3 lines of 32 characters, starting with the ascii
-- character 0x20 (space), which has to remain completely blank. This also means
-- we are only representing characters from 0x20 to 0x7f.
-- Note that the compression system uses a lot of optimization tricks around its
-- huffman representation, and it won't necessarily be able to handle any arbitrary
-- input file as a result. Most fonts files should work however, due to their low
-- entropy nature.
-- The exact format of the output is the following:
--   - 1 byte indicating the offset to the lookup table
--   - 1 byte indicating the offset to the bitstream
--   - the huffman tree
--   - the lookup table
--   - the bitstream
--
-- The tree itself is made of nodes that are two bytes exactly. The root node is
-- at offset 2 of the output, just past the two offset bytes.
--
-- The meaning of each byte in the nodes is the following:
--   - each byte is signed
--   - the first byte is the left "pointer" of the node (or bit 0 from the bitstream)
--   - the second byte is the right "pointer" of the node (or bit 1 from the bitstream)
--   - if a byte is strictly superior to 0, it represents the offset to the next node
--      --> this means the first ever byte in the tree is most likely going to be 0x04
--      --> this means all positive bytes are even, as each node is 2 bytes large
--   - if a byte is negative or 0, it represents the negated value of the lut index
--      --> a leaf node isn't stored in the tree, instead we flag its "pointer"
--      --> signed pointers aren't big enough to store a full byte, hence the lut
--
-- This should explain the decompression algorithm:
--
--        // root node is at offset 2
--        int8_t c = 2;
--        // as long as we didn't hit a leaf, continue down the tree
--        // this is a nice bgtz, at the end of the loop, which doesn't even
--        // need to be primed, as c == 2 at first
--        while (c > 0) {
--            // refresh our bitbucket if needed
--            // the constant 0x100 is easy to store in a register for a simple beq,
--            // while the constant 0x10000 is easy to get from a lui
--            if (bb == 0x100) bb = *data++ | 0x10000;
--            // get the next pointer, and consume a bit off the bitbucket
--            uint32_t bit = bb & 1;
--            bb >>= 1;
--            c = tree[c + bit];
--        }
--        // we hit a leaf, get the corresponding byte off the lut
--        auto b = lut[-c];
--
-- Several notes:
--   - this scheme doesn't allow for a lot of nodes in the tree (62 max)
--   - however, this saves on instructions in the decompression code
--      --> no need to multiply the "next" pointer by 2
--      --> no need to adjust offsets from the root of the tree
--   - these optimizations work well due to the nature of 8 pixels wide fonts
--      --> entropy in a 1bpp encoding will be low enough
--      --> the current system font has 45 distinct bytes, well below the limit
-- Run this code with, for example, the following command:
-- ./pcsx-redux -cli -dofile font-compress.lua -exec "compressFont 'font.raw' PCSX.quit()"
-- First part of this code is a generic min-heap class. It can easily be extracted
-- into its own independant library for other means.
