/**
 * @brief A bump allocator for fragments.
 *
 * @details This allocator is used to allocate fragments without the need for
 * dynamic memory allocation. It is useful for allocating fragments to render in a
 * complex scene, where the number of fragments isn't known at compile time.
 *
 * The allocator will need to be reset at the beginning of each frame, to ensure
 * that the memory is properly reused. Also, don't forget to double buffer the
 * allocator when chaining fragments allocated with it.
 *
 * The allocate method works with both primitives, and custom fragments. It will
 * always return a reference to the allocated fragment.
 *
 * @tparam N The size of the memory buffer in bytes.
