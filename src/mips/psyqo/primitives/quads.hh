 * @brief A flat-colored quad.
 *
 * @details This primitive will draw a flat-colored quad. It will be drawn
 * between the `pointA`, `pointB`, `pointC`, and `pointD` vertices. Note that
 * the ordering of the vertices matters for proper rendering, and it is not
 * intuitive. The quad will be drawn using two triangles: the first triangle
 * will be drawn with the `pointA`, `pointB`, and `pointC` vertices, and the
 * second triangle will be drawn with the `pointB`, `pointC`, and `pointD`
 * vertices. This means that the vertices of the quad need to be sent in a
 * Z pattern to be drawn properly. Failure to do so will result in a weird
 * looking 5-edged polygon resembling a M envelope, which is not what you want.
