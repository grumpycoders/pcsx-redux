 * @brief Takes over the kernel. Can only be called once inside the main function.
 *
 * @details This function will make psyqo take over the retail kernel.
 * This means the application will no longer be able to call any of the
 * kernel functions, and will have to rely on the psyqo kernel instead.
 * Debugging features from third party addons which hook into the kernel
 * will no longer work. Most calls to the kernel will either be no-ops or
 * will crash the application. Most notably, only the `printf` call will
 * be redirected to psyqo's printf, but will not be printing anywhere, so
 * only emulators hooking into A0 calls will be able to see the output.
 *
 * Disabling the kernel is a one-way operation, and cannot be undone.
 * The kernel will be taken over before the first call to `prepare`.
 * The exception handler that psyqo installs will not be able to catch
 * problems, but is much more lightweight and faster than the retail one.
 * Also, 60kB of memory can be reclaimed, and linking the binary with
 * -Xlinker --defsym=TLOAD_ADDR=0x80001000 will allow the application to
 * do just that. This requires a loader able to write into the kernel
 * while disabling interrupts. The ps1-packer tool can achieve that.
 * The first 4kB of memory is reserved for the psyqo kernel.
 *
 * It is noteworthy that while the pros of taking over the kernel are
 * significant, the cons are also significant. The loss of debugging,
 * flexibility, and retail kernel features may not be worth it for most
 * application cases, and should be considered carefully.
 *
 * Last but not least, like with most psyqo features, the added payload
 * to the binary to support the feature will only occur if this function
 * is called.
