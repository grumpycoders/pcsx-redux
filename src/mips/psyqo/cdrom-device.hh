 * @brief A specialization of the CDRom interface.
 *
 * @details This class is a specialization of the CDRom interface, which
 * provides a way to read from the physical CDRom drive of the console.
 * All of the methods in this class are asynchronous, and will call the
 * provided callback when the operation is complete. The class also
 * provides a blocking variant for some of the methods, which can be
 * used to perform the operation synchronously. Note that the blocking
 * variants are only provided for methods that are expected to complete
 * quickly, and should not be used in performance-critical code, as they
 * can still block the system for several milliseconds. The callbacks
 * will be called from the main thread, and have a boolean parameter
 * that indicates whether the operation was successful.
