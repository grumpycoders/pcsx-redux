# PSYQo Tetris example

This is the most complex example so far. It exercises the library to basically do everything.

The code is thoroughly documented in order to explain the theory behind it. The entry point is located in the [`tetris.cpp`](tetris.cpp) file.

The game in itself may need some improvements, but is very playable and enjoyable. Things that can be improved:
- The controls feel a little bit kludgy. The tetrominos won't move repeatedly when the player leaves the left or right buttons pressed down.
- The blocks could use some texturing.
- A option menu during the Pause scene would be great to change the volume, or restart the game.
- The background could use some love with some 3D effects.
- Maybe add typical gameplay improvements such as displaying the upcoming piece.
