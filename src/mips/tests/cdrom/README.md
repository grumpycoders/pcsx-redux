# CDRom tests

This directory contains tests for the CDRom controller of the PS1. They are assuming that there is a CD inserted in the drive, and the lid is closed. The tests require a somewhat specific iso to be mounted. The iso can be created using the `create-test-iso.lua` script. PCSX-Redux itself is the interpreter for this script. It also requires a copy of the [Unirom iso](https://github.com/JonathanDotCel/unirom8_bootdisc_and_firmware_for_ps1/releases/) to be present.

The script can be run using the following command:

```bash
pcsx-redux -cli -iso UNIROM_BOOTDISC.bin -dofile create-test-iso.lua
```

This will emit a `test.cue` file, and multiple corresponding tracks. The data track will contain Unirom itself, for potentially booting on a retail machine and be able to upload the tests to the machine using [`nops`](https://github.com/JonathanDotCel/NOTPSXSerial).

The tests are written in C, and are compiled using the [MIPS GCC toolchain](../../psyqo/GETTING_STARTED.md#the-toolchain). The tests are compiled using the `make` command, and the resulting binary needs to be run on systems that have an ANSI console connected.

One important caveat of the test framework is it'll allocate memory for failed tests, and the memory allocator is very rudimentary. This means that if too many tests fail, the system will run out of memory and crash. Check the file `cdrom.c` to disable portions of tests and work incrementally towards a working emulator. In order to further disable some tests, replace the corresponding `CESTER_TEST` keyword with `CESTER_SKIP_TEST`.

The tests are checking two things: proper results from the CDRom controller, and approximate timings. The former are exact value checks, and will always reproduce properly on the real hardware. The latter are approximate value checks, and will usually only reproduce properly on the real hardware if the CD is inserted in the drive, the lid is closed, and the drive has been settled for a few seconds, but may still be flaky on the real hardware.

The tests are currently being run on a 9001 machine for its real hardware routine checks, with occasional tests being run on a wider range of hardware.

The code is commented to explain what is being tested, and why. The tests are also written to be as self-contained as possible, so that they can be easily copied and modified to test other things.

All in all, these tests are overdoing it in terms of state and feature tests, and over aggressive. PS1 games most definitely do not need this level of accuracy, but this controller is so finicky that it is better to be safe than sorry. An emulator able to pass these tests ought to be able to run anything, as long as the main CPU timings are somewhat accurate. If any of these tests fail, it is likely that the emulator is not emulating the controller properly. If games are still failing despite the tests passing, this would mean there's a behavior not covered by the tests, and they shall be updated accordingly.

A word on timings: the timings are measured using the hblank timer, which is usually pretty easy to get right in terms of accuracy. However, many games will have busy wait loop when talking to the controller, or race conditions between sending commands. This means that if the CPU runs too slow or too quickly, bugs will surface. If the emulator is passing the timing tests, but games are failing, it is likely that the CPU emulation speed accuracy is at fault here, not the controller's.
