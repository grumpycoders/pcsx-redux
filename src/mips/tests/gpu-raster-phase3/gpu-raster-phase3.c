// PS1 GPU rasterizer edge-behavior characterization suite, phase 3.
//
// Phase 3 binary covers edge-walker stress tests - configurations that
// exercise the soft renderer's setupSections* / nextRow* family in
// non-trivial ways:
//
//   - edge-walker-stress.c    Degenerate triangles (near-vertical,
//                             near-horizontal), longest-edge boundary
//                             cases, slope-fraction sweeps, 4-vertex
//                             quad sweep paths.
//
// Companion to the in-flight Phase 4 refactor unifying edge walkers
// across 3-vert and 4-vert families (soft.cc:1239-1747). Shares
// raster-helpers.h with phase-1 via -I../gpu-raster-phase1.
